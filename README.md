# AI Moon Landing using pytorch

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Deep Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning technique, to autonomously land a spacecraft on the moon. By simulating the lunar landing environment, the AI learns optimal actions through trial and error, aiming to achieve a safe and precise landing.

## Final Learning Outcome Video
At the conclusion of the training process, i have included a video showcasing the AI's ultimate learning achievement. This video demonstrates the AI successfully landing on the moon, highlighting the effectiveness of the Deep Q-Learning.
